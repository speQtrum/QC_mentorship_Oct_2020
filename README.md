# QC_mentorship_Oct_2020
Application screening task for QC mentorship program October,2020. Here I have performed a solution of TASK-4. The solution is in the **"Task_4.ipynb"** notebook. I have used latex for writing mathematical equations and they are working fine in local jupyter environment, but not rendered properly in **GITHUB** repo. So, I have uploaded another **"Task_4.pdf"** file which is a pdf copy of the actual notebook and it is pretty okay. Though I'll request you to clone the repo and open "Task4.ipynb" from local jupyter environment for best experience. 

**Please compare "Task_4.ipynb" and "Task_4.pdf" side by side to understand the latex equations**
Thank you
